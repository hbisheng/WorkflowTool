# WorkflowTool

<b>Author: Bisheng Huang</b>

A small tool used to improve self-efficiency.

We can use this tool to take down what we are doing. And the time will be recorded.

1. This will get us back on track easily if we get distracted.
2. The records are split by day. We can better recall what we have done on a certain day. You would have a better understanding of where time has gone if we keep writing things to it.

Use Alt+Shift+W to show it and hide it. More features will be introduced in the future.
